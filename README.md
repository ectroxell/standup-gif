# StandUp.gif ðŸ“º

An ATC Innovation Day project

Ever been in stand-up and wanted to show your team a gif of your daily update? This is the app for you!
Our goal is to provide a quick and easy way to share your daily update with your team infused with a little fun.
Type in your stand up update, select a tone, and let the app do the rest!

## Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)

```bash
quasar dev
```
